# Board Game Project (codename: `azul`)

## Overview
We're implementing a physical board game online for social distanced play. BoardGameArena.com is a platform for playing realtime or turn-based board games online. This has become a highly valuable tool during the pandemic when in-person social board gaming opportunities are limited. BGA allows developers to add board games using the platform they've already built. This means we can focus on the game-writing code and not be bogged down by the rest. Further, building a game on BGA will multiple our impact and let many people enjoy our work. The specific board game has yet to be decided, though there's a large list of available licenses.

## Collaboration
The client-site portion to display a graphical representation of the board game's current state is completely separated and would be a good sub-task for members to collaborate on, perhaps a pair or trio and this is quite the task and has a lot of creative freedom on UX. Separately someone could even plan the front-end experience with sketches and interaction design. The database design might be non-trivial and would make a great exercise for anyone in DevHQ. The backend could be developed by a separate individual or team and already has interactions defined with the front end (though communication will be required to sync on data formats). Someone without PHP experience could even work on translating the written rules from the rulebook to pseudocode that the backend will enforce. In total 5 or more people could easily collaborate on this project.

## Impact
106,000 people play on Board Game Arena. Once this project is complete, anyone can freely access the site and play the board game we've implemented.
